# BatchPoC
Spring Batch PoC

This is just a very basic PoC of Spring Batch. The master branch has a classic single running when executed approach (you start the java app and then it executes the batch jobs).

The Scheluder branch drops the single running approach and instead uses a scheduler approach (it runs two jobs manually every 30 seconds).
